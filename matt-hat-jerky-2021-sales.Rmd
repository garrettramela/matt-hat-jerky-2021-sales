## Data Set Overview

Our data set includes sales data from January to October 2021 grouped by month, sales channel, location, customer type, product, and product type. Each record contains the number of orders, gross sales, discounts, returns, net sales, shipping, taxes, total sales, total tips, and average order value.

The data set contains:

28071 records<br>
18 variables

1. Month = month (character)
2. Sales Channel = api_client_title (character)
3. Shipped to City = shipping_city (character)
4. Shipped to Region = shipping_region (character)
5. Shipping to Country = shipping_country (character)
6. First/Return Customer Type = customer_type (character)
7. Matt-Hat Jerky Product Name = product_title (character)
8. Matt-Hat Jerky Product Type = product_type (character)
9. Number of Orders = orders (integer)
10. Gross Sales = gross_sales (number)
11. Discounts = discounts (number)
12. Returns = returns (number)
13. Net Sales = net_sales (number) = Gross Sales - Discounts - Returns
14. Shipping = shipping (number)
15. Taxes = taxes (number)
16. Total Sales = total_sales (number) Net Sales + Shipping + Taxes
17. Total Tips = total_sales (number)
18. Average Order Value = average_order_value (number)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```{r}
# Read the data into RStudio & assign it to the 'sales' variable.
sales <- read.csv('sales_2021_YTD.csv')

# Take an initial look at the data frame fields, records, data types, etc. to see if anything seems off.
summary(sales)
head(sales, 20)
View(sales)
```

There seems to some missing values in the product title and product type fields just by viewing the first 20 records of the data set.

```{r}
uniqueTime <- unique(sales[1], incomparables = FALSE)
uniqueSalesChannel <- unique(sales[2], incomparables = FALSE)
uniqueCity <- unique(sales[3], incomparables = FALSE)
uniqueRegion <- unique(sales[4], incomparables = FALSE)
uniqueCountry <- unique(sales[5], incomparables = FALSE)
uniqueCustomerType <- unique(sales[6], incomparables = FALSE)
uniqueProductTitle <- unique(sales[7], incomparables = FALSE)
uniqueProductType <- unique(sales[8], incomparables = FALSE)

uniqueTime
uniqueSalesChannel
uniqueCity
uniqueRegion
uniqueCountry
uniqueCustomerType
uniqueProductTitle
uniqueProductType

# Research Questions

1. Which sales channel, location, and product combination are most likely to produce high lifetime value (LTV) customers? High LTV customers are those we high order counts, and high net sales (minimal discounts & returns).

2. Which sales channel, location, and product combination are likely to produce returning customers?

3. Which sales channel, location, and product combination produce the highest average order value (AOV)? AOV is used in determining how much marketing dollars are worth spending.

```{r}
# salesWithDummies <- dummy_cols(sales, select_columns = c('api_client_title', 'shipping_region', 'product_title'), remove_selected_columns = TRUE)
# 
# ltvRegression <- lm(net_sales ~ ., data=salesWithDummies)
# 
# summary(ltvRegression)
